## About Me

I'm an AI Engineer and Computer Engineering graduate student at Clemson University, passionate about building intelligent, real-world solutions with a strong focus on computer vision, LLMs, and agentic AI. I have 2+ years of end-to-end AI/ML development experience, ranging from preprocessing data and training models to deploying optimized pipelines on cloud and edge platforms. My work spans multi-modal perception, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and collaborative AI agent systems for enterprise and research.

I've engineered computer vision and NLP solutions for autonomous vehicles, real-time document analysis, and production-grade knowledge management systems‚Äîleveraging tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, LangChain, and LangGraph. I thrive on fast prototyping, performance optimization, and working with diverse teams to turn ideas into impactful products.
